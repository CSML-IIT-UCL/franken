# Installation

To install `franken`, start by setting up your environment with the correct version of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). This is especially necessary if you wish to use GPUs. Then install `franken` by running
```bash
pip install franken
```
The basic installation comes bare-bones without any GNN backbone installed. You can install franken with a specific backbone directly, by running one of the following commands
```bash
pip install franken[cuda,mace]
pip install franken[cuda,fairchem]
pip install franken[cuda,sevenn]
```
In more detail:
 - the `cuda` qualifier installs dependencies which are only relevant on GPU-enabled environments and can be omitted.
 - the three supported backbones are [MACE](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace), [SchNet from fairchem](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem), and [SevenNet](https://github.com/MDIL-SNU/SevenNet). They are explained in more detail below.


```{note}
Each backbone seems to have mutually incompatible requirements, particularly with regards to `e3nn` - but also pytorch versions might be a problem. For this reason, we suggest that the user who wishes to use multiple backbones creates independent python environments for each, such as to minimize potential incompatibilities.
The `mace-torch` package requires an old version of `e3nn` which **may** conflict with `fairchem-core`, see [this relevant issue](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace/issues/555) . If this is occurring, simply upgrade `e3nn` by running `pip install -U e3nn`.
```

## Supported pre-trained models
### MACE MP0
We support [`MACE-MP0`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00096) by Batatia et al. Additional informations on the pre-training of `MACE-MP0` are available on its [HuggingFace model card](https://huggingface.co/cyrusyc/mace-universal). To use `MACE-MP0` as a backbone for `franken` just `pip`-install `mace-torch` in `franken`'s environment
```bash
pip install mace-torch
```
or directly install franken with mace support (`pip install franken[cuda,mace]`).

In addition to MACE-MP0 trained on the materials project dataset, Franken also supports the [`MACE-OFF` models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15211) for organic chemistry.

```{note}
The `mace-torch` package requires a version of `e3nn` which *may* conflict with `fairchem-core`, see [this relevant issue](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace/issues/555). If this is occurring, and you need both `fairchem` and `mace`, simply install `mace-torch` *after* `fairchem-core` so that the version of `e3nn` being installed is compatible with `mace-torch`. The models currently implemented from `fairchem` **do not need** `e3nn`.
```

### SchNet OC20 (fairchem, formerly OCP)
We support the [SchNet model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08566) by Sch√ºtt et al. as implemented in the [`fairchem`](https://fair-chem.github.io/) library by Meta's FAIR. The pre-training was done on the [Open Catalyst dataset](https://fair-chem.github.io/core/datasets/oc20.html). To use it as a backbone for `franken`, install the `fairchem` library
```bash
pip install fairchem-core
```
and the `torch_geometric` dependencies as explained in the [FairChem docs](https://fair-chem.github.io/core/install.html).
```{note}
Not all of fairchem's dependencies can be installed by `pip` alone, check the [FairChem docs](https://fair-chem.github.io/core/install.html).
```

### SevenNet

Franken also supports the [SevenNet model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03789) by Park et al. as implemented in the [`sevennet`](https://github.com/MDIL-SNU/SevenNet) library. .
We have only tested the SevenNet-0 model trained on the materials project dataset, but support for other models should be possible (open an issue if you encounter any problem).
